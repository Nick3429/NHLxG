# NHLxG
The goal of this project is to use NHL shot data to implement an expected goals model (xG) to see which players were expected to have the most goals during the 2023-24 season. By doing this, we can evaluate the offensive ability of NHL players in terms of getting high quality shots that lead to goals. 

At a high level, xG is simply a way to predict how likely a shot on goal will result in a goal. The data I used is courtesy of moneypuck.com.
